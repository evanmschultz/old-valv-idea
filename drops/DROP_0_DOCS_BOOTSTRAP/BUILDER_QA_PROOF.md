# DROP_0 — Builder QA Proof

## Unit 0.4 — Round 1

**Verdict:** PASS

### Findings

| ID | Severity | Criterion | Evidence | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | — | No findings — all acceptance criteria and scope checks pass cleanly. | — |

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Crit | Description | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ls` of all six paths exits `0` | PASS | `/bin/ls` of the six paths printed all six and returned `EXIT=0`. |
| 2 | Each file's `head -1` byte-exactly matches expected heading; BOM-free | PASS | Per-file table below — all six headings match; `xxd -l 3` returns `23 20 <letter>` on every file (no `ef bb bf` BOM). |
| 3 | `wc -l` ≥ 3 on every file | PASS | Per-file table below — every file reports exactly `3` lines (meets the floor). |
| 4 | `grep -c '^## DROP_0'` returns `0` on every file | PASS | Per-file table below — every file reports `0`. |
| 5 | All six Phase 7 append targets resolve to existing files | PASS | Covered by criterion 1 (same six paths). |

Per-file evidence for criteria 2/3/4:

| File | `head -1` | First 3 bytes (xxd) | `wc -l` | `grep -c '^## DROP_0'` | Line 3 (purpose) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `WIKI.md` | `# WIKI` | `23 20 57` (`# W`) | 3 | 0 | `Living best-practice snapshot for Valv.` |
| `LEDGER.md` | `# LEDGER` | `23 20 4c` (`# L`) | 3 | 0 | `Drop-by-drop changelog for Valv — what shipped, when, and why.` |
| `REFINEMENTS.md` | `# REFINEMENTS` | `23 20 52` (`# R`) | 3 | 0 | `Post-drop refinement backlog — deferred findings and future-round work.` |
| `HYLLA_FEEDBACK.md` | `# HYLLA_FEEDBACK` | `23 20 48` (`# H`) | 3 | 0 | `Per-drop record of Hylla misses — searches that forced fallback to Read/Grep/Glob.` |
| `HYLLA_REFINEMENTS.md` | `# HYLLA_REFINEMENTS` | `23 20 48` (`# H`) | 3 | 0 | `Proposed Hylla improvements derived from recorded misses.` |
| `WIKI_CHANGELOG.md` | `# WIKI_CHANGELOG` | `23 20 57` (`# W`) | 3 | 0 | `Per-drop WIKI.md change summaries.` |

Additional (non-acceptance) gate checks:

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose subheading present on line 3 of each file | PASS | Line 3 column above — all six populated with a meaningful purpose line. |
| PLAN.md U0.4 state flipped to `done` | PASS | PLAN.md line 92: `- **State:** done`. |
| BUILDER_WORKLOG.md has `## Unit 0.4 — Round 1` with required fields | PASS | WORKLOG line 7 opens `## Unit 0.4 — Round 1`; lines 9–12 carry `**Scope:**`, `**Files created:**`, `**Mage targets run:**`, `**Design notes:**` in order. |

### Scope / Commit Hygiene

Commit `7c4c9b627f07b6f68c7179ea6ebf261d7645f523` — `docs(drop-0): bootstrap phase-7 closeout artifacts` — stat:

| Expected (8 files) | Actual (8 files) | Match |
|---|---|---|
| `main/WIKI.md` (new) | `WIKI.md` +3 | OK |
| `main/LEDGER.md` (new) | `LEDGER.md` +3 | OK |
| `main/REFINEMENTS.md` (new) | `REFINEMENTS.md` +3 | OK |
| `main/HYLLA_FEEDBACK.md` (new) | `HYLLA_FEEDBACK.md` +3 | OK |
| `main/HYLLA_REFINEMENTS.md` (new) | `HYLLA_REFINEMENTS.md` +3 | OK |
| `main/WIKI_CHANGELOG.md` (new) | `WIKI_CHANGELOG.md` +3 | OK |
| `main/drops/DROP_0_DOCS_BOOTSTRAP/BUILDER_WORKLOG.md` (modified) | `drops/DROP_0_DOCS_BOOTSTRAP/BUILDER_WORKLOG.md` +7 | OK |
| `main/drops/DROP_0_DOCS_BOOTSTRAP/PLAN.md` (modified) | `drops/DROP_0_DOCS_BOOTSTRAP/PLAN.md` +1/-1 | OK |

Eight files expected, eight files touched, zero extras. Total `+26 -1` matches the 6×3 new-scaffold writes + 7-line WORKLOG append + 1-line PLAN state flip. Commit subject conforms to the `type(scope): message` convention. No body, no bullet lists, no trailers.

### Verdict

All five U0.4 acceptance criteria pass on-disk, all three additional gate checks (purpose subheading on line 3, PLAN.md state flipped to `done`, BUILDER_WORKLOG.md Round 1 section well-formed) pass, and the bootstrap commit's scope is exactly the eight expected files with nothing else. The six durable Phase 7 closeout artifacts are in place, BOM-free, 3-line minimal scaffolds, and free of pre-populated `## DROP_0` stubs that could collide with real Phase 7 appends. Proof-QA verdict: PASS.
